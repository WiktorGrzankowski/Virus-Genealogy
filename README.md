# Virus-Genealogy
This program simulates a creation of a virus and its multiple possible mutations.
virus_genealogy.h puts emphasis on exception-safety. Every method is, if possible,
no-throw and if not, then it is still strong-guarante.
It is written in object-oriented paradigm, uses smart pointers, custom
exceptions, resursive containers and a custom iterator. 
example.cc shows how virus_genealogy.h library works.
